# Document-QA

This project is built for research and personal use only. 

The aim of this project is to make proofreading and revision easier by allowing the user to engage in a Q&A session with their documents. Keep in mind that the OpenAI key has been taken out from the code due to privacy reasons, and each user will have to edit the code by uploading theirs. This project was built and inspired by langchain, a framework for developing LLM applications.
